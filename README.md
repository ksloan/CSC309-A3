NOTES:
    - We tested using Firefox 19.0.2 on Windows, and Mobile Safari on iOS
    - We went with a reponsive design that changes layouts at 768px width
    - We also did a lot of coding as a team in the labs
    - To see user info, you need to tap/click on the users thumbnail, name, or screen name
    - Media posts load in an in-app lightbox, and all other links open in a new window
